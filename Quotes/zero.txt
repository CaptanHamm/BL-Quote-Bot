As my voice changes / I cannot help but feel wrong / I sound like a jerk  
Leaves falling from trees / Snow drifting onto the ground / Life leaving your corpse.  
He was no challenge. / My skills have not been tested. / I need something more.  
...This is intriguing. / The Vault, my masterpiece? / Challenge accepted.  
Why do you retreat? / Face your end honorably. / Make me work for it.  
This is punishment / His murder will be avenged / And I will be paid.  
For you to fight back. / Bandits like you are easy / I want a challenge. 
This is the story / All about how my life got / Flipped, turned upside-down.
How hilarious / You just set off my trap card / Your death approaches.
What's the hold up? / Is someone in the bathroom? / Are you on the phone?
What is going on? / Why have my limbs stopped moving? / Has my heart just died?
Bor-ed, bor-ed, bored / Bored, bored, bored, bored, bored, bored, bored / I am really bored.
Boredom is my lot, / As I lack autonomy / To move my own feet.

I am bored as hell / I would like to kill something / Can we friggin go?
I sit here and wait / So eager to move onward / But it's all in vain.
Can we start moving? / I grow tired of this spot / I long to explore.
The peaceful silence / Penetrates my whole being / It's so very dull.
Someone is busy. / Now we play the waiting game; / Everyone loses.
What is the holdup? / Is someone in the bathroom? / Are you on the phone?
Your eyes deceive you / An illusion fools you all / I move for the kill.
The true world revealed / Weaknesses now known to me / Time to go to work.
And I disappear / A ghost amidst the combat / Preparing to strike.
A critical hit / So very satisfying / I live for such kills.
Critical killing / Is an art unto itself / And I am Rembrandt.
A critical kill / Showers me in blood and spit / How enjoyable.
That was your own fault / You should have paid attention / And looked through the lie.
Sorry, did that hurt? / That "sorry" was sarcasm / I am not sorry.
I feel the burning / Eating through my equipment / Must stop, drop, and roll.
I'm covered in slag! / I must seek cover quickly / or pain is coming.
Disgusting, this slag / Inelegant chemical / Increases damage.
A new instrument, / Waiting for a sonata / That I will conduct.
Maybe I'll use you / To blow a midget's head off. / Or maybe I won't.
Comparisons made / But which is superior? / A tough decision.
A most confused death / Dead before he even knew / Where I had struck from.
Striking from nowhere / Killing with accuracy / This is who I am.
Yoo-hoo, stupid guy / I was really over here / Too bad you're dead now.
I am everywhere / And yet, I am nowhere, too / I am infinite.
Farewell, foolish thing / Know that you have been deceived / As your soul moves on.
This is how you die / A spectacle of violence / Gorgeous and ugly.
I relish your death / You are so unsuspecting / How satisfying.
I say, boom biatch / That's what you get for messing / With the Assassin.
I have destroyed you / A deadly shot from nowhere / The ghost Assassin.
Over here you fools / That was but an illusion / I am your true foe.
You fought well creature / But I fought so much better / I'll pick your corpse now.
Assassinated / What a satisfying word / With five syllables.
What happened to you? / So strong, imposing, fearsome / Oh yeah, I killed you.
I witness your death / You were so unsuspecting / How satisfying.
That is called "roadkill" / Not the cleverest of words / But appropriate.
This is the story / All about how my life got / Flipped, turned upside-down.
What was that speed bump / That fell under my tires? / Was that thing alive?
I am nearly dead / It's time for a second wind / Let my aim be true.
I will not die here / I still have too much to do / And too much ammo.
I won't die today / Not while I still have ammo / I am a badass.
I have arisen / You will regret harming me / My vengeance at hand.
Second Wind achieved / Pulled back from the brink of death / I'm ready for more.
I'm back from the dead / To continue to raise hell / Get out of my way.
You should now be scared / I don't die so easily / And now I am pissed.
Nice try savages / I am not the dying type / You shall die instead.
This does not end here / I have much further to go / Before I fall dead.
I got Second Wind / Metaphorically speaking / Breath overrated.
I am eternal / Death will never capture me / My skills exceed his.
I thank you for your / Kindness and sincerity. / Now, let's kill some stuff.
Thank you for saving / A not so innocent life / By reviving me.
Why, yes, I do have / The skills to pay all my bills / Figuratively.
Oh, what? Yeah, what, bitch? / Yeah, I just slapped you and stuff. / What you gonna do?
Let's duel, you and I / So we can compare weapons / And know who is more skilled.
A chance to spar is / Something I always adore / I'm ready to fight.
Was that a stiff wind? / Or a fly landing on me? / I barely felt it.
A victory earned / A hard fought battle, that was / I honor my foe.
That was a fine fight / I say that due to your skill / Not because I won.
I lost fair and square / Whatever that dumb phrase means / Who loses a square?
The battle complete / The warriors are equal / Identical skills.
Hey, this area / Smells vaguely of butts and death / An unpleasant stench.
You look troubled, ma'am / Tell me how I may help you / I long for a quest.
I broke my fingers / What a ludicrous mistake / Damned critical fails
What does this thing do? / How do I solve this puzzle? / Look it up online? 
I care not for cash / Only for the pure combat / That said, I'll buy guns.
If your love awaits / Why are you standing out here? / Let's save her, stupid.
Life is very short / One day you will grow older / And then you will die.
Combat is my love / Brutal violence, my partner / I need no one else.
A smoking cigar / Is so much less interesting / Than a smoking gun.
To love one's mother? / An unusual feeling. / You're on your own.
I need your blonde wig / For reasons unimportant / May I please have it?
I am on a quest / Which requires that blonde wig / So uh, I need it.
Sorry about this. / I wanna finish the quest. / Nothing personal.
Lubrication is / A means of making things work. / His is grease. Mine? Blood. 
Your wooing tactic / Is completely transparent. / Your neg does not work.
Hammerlock has left / A large amount of moonshine / Distilled it himself.
Remote charges have / A very long broadcast range / His death came form space.
Like the old story / Of he with the waxen wings / Except bloodier
He wanted a break / Now he can rest forever / But who poisoned him?
He hangs in the air / The breeze stirring his body / Animate, yet not.
Hyperion scum / Trying to catch a monster / Oh, the irony
I understand it. / A message sent, and received. / Mercy is coming.
As my voice changes / I cannot help but feel wrong / I sound like a jerk.
Now, I have Jack's voice / I truly understand him / He is an asshole.
Since I speak as Jack / I know him, inside and out / Which sounds kind of gross.
I miss my old voice / I sound like a jackass now / Pun not intended.
