Always opening doors for me, *telling me I'm beautiful, shooting anyone in the face if they looked at me sideways. Course, then he got clingy and I *dropped him like a bad habit -- which as it turns out, wasn't the best idea.",
					"One step closer to rebuilding the Underdome. Jack didn't take it too well when I kicked him to the curb. Way he figured it, if he couldn't have the thing he loved, neither could I. He sent his goons to burn the Underdome to the ground. I think he's planning to rebuild it in his own image, but he's missing the stuff that made it great... the flash, the pizzazz, the personality... and his tits aren't as nice.",
					"They say money can't buy you love, but it's a damned good replacement. Though, Mordecai might disagree with that. Poor guy... I offered him a rakk hive's worth of guns and cash for winning the top spot in my Underdome, but he never wanted any of it. If I had a nickel for every time he asked me to run away with him? Well, I wouldn't need a tip jar, that's for sure.",
					"Thanks for the tips, sugar. I think it's time your generosity was... rewarded.",
					"I tell ya, sugar: the resistance was desperate for someone like you. Roland's a real sweetheart, but everybody knows this city's just a skagleap away from getting torn apart by Hyperion or the bandits. We all thought we were safe in New Haven a few years back, but that... that didn't turn out so well.",
					"I appreciate it, darlin' -- business hasn't been so hot since Hyperion rolled into town. They talk big about cleaning up the wasteland and civilizing Pandora, but it really just comes down to two things: money and control. And Hyperion wants both.",
					"You met Ellie yet? Lovely girl. Hates my guts. I tried to explain to her, there's no harm in putting just a little effort into your appearance. A little rouge here, some dieting there -- reasonable requests, I thought -- but a few years of that were enough to make her move out to The Dust. Said something about making her own way, that she didn't need Scooter or I. Kids, you know?",
					"Thanks! This place ain't doing great, but it's still doing better than most -- nothing dulls the pain of losing a war quite like a strong glass of rakk-ale.",
					"Appreciated, sugar. That reminds me of something Jimbo Hodunk told me right before me and the kids left his disgusting bandit clan forever. He said, Hng dong pohng, bern-downg, hash-bohn buh-ba. Jowm, hmm. I'll never forget that.",
					"You haven't met the Hodunks yet, have you? Bastards, every one of 'em. They think just 'cause you're born into their stupid clan, you have to follow their rules, date who they tell you to date, murder who they tell you to murder, and -- yeugh. Good lawrd, I am so glad the kids and I left that STUPID clan fer-- oh god. Oh god, did I go back into the accent? Oh no. Oh crap. DON'T TELL ANYBODY.",
					"Fair warning: you call me wench, I shoot you in the kneecap.",
					"Have a drink, gamble, or punch my more douchebaggy clientele until they explode. Up to you.",
					"So, I'm in a world entirely of Tiny Tina's creation, huh? If it weren't for how great my rack looks, I'd say this might be what hell is like.",
					"Ellie gets to be the cool swordmaster, and I'm a tavern owner? Friggin' typecasting.",
					"Given the setting, I should probably have some fantasy-themed innuendos ready. Mind if I bounce 'em off you? Ahem. I'd like to tame your dragon, if you know what I -- nope, that... this is awful. Totally forced. Pretend it never happened.",

And if you don't, I'm gonna have to pull out the big guns -- I'll hit ya with the silent treatment. See how you like that. (Long pause.) Yep. Giving you the silent treatment.

					"You hear me, Jack?! You killed my friends! You destroyed my product line! I am the last Claptrap in existence, AND I AM GOING TO TEABAG YOUR CORPSE!",
					"A door?! You think a door can stop me, Jack?! I was MADE to open doors! HAHAHAHA!",
					"Sic 'em, minion!",
					"Best! Minion! Ever!",
					"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! DAMN YOU, STAIRS! DAMN YOU TO HELL!",
					"Minion, you’ve gotta go on without me! Do your master proud!",
					"Buddy?! Everything okay? Are you dead? I have no idea what’s going on right now!",
					"That’s right, Jack! I conquered your stairs! Prepare to feel the wrath of a CLAPTRAP WITH LEGS!",
					"This feels good. Feels right.",
					"AHHHHH! Minion, draw their fire with your face while I cloak my way over to the door controls!",
					"Well my name is claptrap and I'm on pandora where the fauna is strange but so is the flora and I'm always just tryin' to get open the door-a and I always have a hard time and it's…just…what rhymes with time?",
					"GOD F*CKING DAMMIT!",
					"I'm overriding the door locks! Just stay alive, minion!",
					"HOLY SH*T! IT ACTUALLY WORKED! The turrets are fighting for us now! I ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING!",
					"STAIRS?! GOD DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!!",
					"Badasses incoming!",
					"We got war loaders, friendo!",
					"AVOID the bullets! AVOID THEM!",
					"Shit on a cracker! More bots incoming!",
					"Fuck that noise -- bring ME the fur, and I’ll give you a shotgun!",
					"I'm very disappointed in you, minion! (beat.) Now I'm over it. We're best friends again!",
					"FUR MOHAWK, BABY! WOOO! You made the right decision, minion.",
					"It's my birthday! I first rolled off the assembly line seven years ago! Do me a favor and hand out these invites for my stellar birthday bash, will ya? And quickly -- we're gonna start any minute!",
					"Minion! Over here! Your master commands you!",
					"(trying to maintain a semblance of authority) Well done, minion. You passed the tests. Just as I expected.",
					"Since I still don't hear you laughing about “chill out”, you must not understand humor in general. See, humor is based on subverting expectations, often through play-on words. According to this formula of humor, my “chill out” comment was literally the funniest thing ever said by anyone.",
					"Okay -- you've got dynamite on all the furnaces, which means it's time to set it all off! Go use the remote detonator I had one of the Crimson Raiders set up out there. When he asked me why, I just told him: BE COOL. (beat.) HOW ARE YOU NOT LAUGHING RIGHT NOW?! That was F*CKING GOLD!",
					"The statues are bulletproof? You win this round, inanimate object!",
					"Take THAT, easily-replaced decoration!",
					"Protect the bot, minion!",
					"Three - two - one -- DANCE TIME!",
					"Oh. He, uh, just exploded, didn't he? I guess that's kinda like dancing.",
					"You are looking FABULOOOOOOUS!",
					"Claptrap beatbox time, check it! (claptrap beatboxing)",
					"I used to be somebody. Granted, that “somebody” was an insane, megalomaniacal revolutionary who wanted to destroy all of humanity and over-used air quotes, but at least I was respected! (beat.) No I wasn't. Sigh.",
					"(making a really upbeat song out of it) Sad and lonely, sad and lonely -- lonely and sad! I got no friends but that's okay, cause at least I got…uh…hands. Hands and no friends, hands and no friends, that's the life for meeee.",
					"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Sorry. I was just thinking about the horrors I've seen since coming to Pandora. Won't happen again, I promise. (beat.) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Dang. My bad.",
					"Wanna hear the new dubstep song I wrote? Wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub DROP! (pause.) Wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub.",
					"It's a heck of a burden, being the last of your kind. Never will I hear the laugh of another Claptrap. Or dance alongside one. Or be tied to a pole and tortured with hot pokers by one because somebody reprogrammed its friend-or-foe priorities.",
					"I wonder if there are any other Claptraps out there who survived Jack's recall. I wonder what I'd say to them if we ever met. (beat.) Actually, I'd probably just tell them to shove off. There's only room enough for ONE dancing robot with a comedically divisive personality around here, and it's me!",
					"Anybody wanna check me out? Watch me dance? Listen to me tell you that there are new missions available on a bounty board? (beat) Heavy sigh.",
					"I gotta pee.",
					"You survived? I mean, uh, you survived! Yay! I totally expected that!",
					"Unce unce unce.",
					"So lonely.",
					"Continue to stare awkwardly at me, minion! Yessss. You follow orders well.",
					"Oh, I almost forgot, minion. If you hear anyone calling me “Clappy,” please politely explain my hatred for that nickname while you beat the stuffing out of them with a length of rebar.",
					"Soooooo...Moxxi said anything about me?",
					"I love you. What? Who said that? I didn’t say anything.",
					"Did you know my head is at your crotch level? I'm trying not to think about it.",
					"Others might find it unnerving when someone just stares at them for a long period of time without speaking. But me? I'm just happy to have you around!",
					"You make me so proud, minion. The way you're carrying on my fight against Handsome Jack -- it brings a tear to my eye. A figurative one, of course. The saline content of actual tears would rust my eye quicker than you could say “tetanus shot.”",
					"How you feelin', minion? You feelin' good? I'm feelin' good.",
					"You know, this whole last-of-my-kind thing isn't so bad. Gives me a lot of “me” time, you know? Time to think things over, defrag my hard drive, wonder if there is a robot heaven and, if so, whether my Claptrap brethren are in it -- you know, stuff like that. It involves lots of crying.",
					"Damn you, Jack! We could have settled this like MEN!",
					"Me! Me! Me! I know! I know!",
					"Pick me! Pick me!",
					"Yes! I NAILED it!",
					"IT WAS JUST A QUESTION, MISTER FLYNT!"

His name is Sir Reginald Von Bartlesby, a local aristocrat and purveyor of the fine arts. I believe his mother has forbidden him from speaking with me. You will convince her to release him into my custody.",
