          "I tried to keep to myself, but nooo! You Hyperion bastards HAD to come after me -- you just HAD to kill Dusty!...You wanna treat me like a bandit, that’s EXACTLY what I’m gonna be!",
          "You made it to my throne room, recruit -- but now it's time for the real initiation! Slabs! RIP 'EM UUUUP!",
          "Dusty...was just a puppy -- almost as nice as my first dog! You let your boss know I’m gonna do to him exactly what he did to her. 'cept slower. You --",
          "Now that you're warmed up, let's get SERIOUS! NEXT!",
          "The pain's a-coming! Get ready, recruit!",
          "What do you MEAN they ain’t from Hyperion? Ohhhh -- must be a new recruit! Alright, boys, let's put 'em through the ringer!",
          "If you Slabs can't wreck some random recruit, how the hell are you gonna hurt Jack? By cramping his trigger finger?",
          "The recruit's in the buzzard factory! Hell, I hope he kills the rest of you worthless slabs!",
          "That was disgusting -- I love it!",
          "You slabs are pathetic!",
          "I haven't seen moves like that in years!",
          "The recruit's makin' you look like idiots! Slabs, go get 'em!",
          "You slabs suck!",
          "You call yourselves badasses?! The Vault Hunter's wipin' the floor with ya!",
          "Cover is for wusses -- get your ass up and fight!",
          "Did you see that guy's face melt?! AHAHAH!",
          "Ahaha -- you slabs thought you had 'em, didn't ya?!",
          "Uh oh -- goliath on the loose!",
          "Better kill that goliath quick -- he's powering up!",
          "Hand to hand, just how I like it!",
          "You idiots always wanted to fight another Vault Hunter -- well, now's your chance!",
          "I love a good elemental kill!",
          "You killed some of my best men just to get to me. I only got one thing to say to you.",
          "That was AWESOME!",

          "So, whatcha want?",
          "Heh. I was wondering when Roland'd call in that favor. So -- the bunker. Now that you’re one of us, my buzzards could help you take her down. Go tell Roland I’m in.",
          "Oh, and just so you know? My slabs'll probly still try to kill ya, cause they're friggin' idiots. Don't feel bad about killin' em. I never do.",
          "What the -- Hyperion assault! Look out!",
          "God dammit, I am so SICK of these earthquakes! If I could punch this planet in the face, I would!",
          "Aw, crap! Slab, we gotta stop those mortars or there won’t be nobody left to help you with the bunker!",
          "That's enough; you did good! Get back here!",
          "Wow. You ARE a true Slab!",
          "I'm proud to call you a Slab. When the time comes to take out that bunker, my buzzards'll be there.",
          "Follow me! Jack musta dropped some beacons to guide the mortars! If we don't destroy the beacons, we're dead!",
          "Tell Jack I’m comin’ for him next!",
          "Eat fist, you Hyperion rakksucks!",
          "Hyperion’s gotta DIE!",
          "Damn, I'm good!",
          "Show me some blood!",
          "KNOCK KNOCK, BITCHES! OPEN UP!",
          "Badass job, Slab! You remind me of me, back in the old days. With those Odomo charges,my boys'll help you break into the Info Stockade and find out where Jack's got Lilith and the Warrior. I'll let Mordecai know you're headed back to Sanctuary.",
          "Slab, did you -- did you just, did you just jump off The Buzzard's Nest? ...God DAMN you make me proud!",
          "Slab, did you -- did you just, did you just jump off The Buzzard's Nest? ...God DAMN you make me proud!",
          "Slab, did you -- did you just, did you just jump off The Buzzard's Nest? ...God DAMN you make me proud!",
          "BOOM!",
          "Mordecai told me what happened to Roland. So here's what we do. We bury Roland. We save this planet. And we kill Jack, his associates, his friends, his FAMILY -- everyone's he's EVER MET! WE SKIN 'EM WITH THEIR OWN GODDAMN TEETH! (heavy breathing) I'm sorry. We went our separate ways a few years back, but Roland was my friend. And nobody -- nobody -- hurts my friends.",
          "I wish I had more warriors like you. Between us, the rest of these slabs are kinda useless.",
          "You punched anything lately?",
          "I'm gonna kill him, Mordy."

          "Man, this is great! Now that I've met a mighty vault hunter, I can finally join the resistance in Sanctuary, take vengeance against Jack for killing my product line, and repair my central processor so I stop thinking out loud! (beat.) I wonder what it's like to have a belly button.",

          "Keep your wits about you, minion -- this glacier’s run by a bandit named Captain Flynt. The jerk kept me as his torture plaything for a few months. We played games like “dodge the blowtorch,” and “don’t get dunked into the pool of acid.” I was really good at the first one.",

          "...You still there? I don't hear Bullymongs anymore. Kinda just waiting on you. To get me outta here. But please, take your time. (Beat.) Can't help but notice you're not getting me out of here. Maybe you're thinking, oh, Claptrap's such a strong and noble paragon of justice and skill, he can get himself out. Which, most of the time, you would be totally right about. But as it stands right now, I could use some help. And if you don't, I'm gonna have to pull out the big guns -- I'll hit ya with the silent treatment. See how you like that. (Long pause.) Yep. Giving you the silent treatment. Feel the sting of my passive-aggression. Being totally silent. (Long pause.) Not talking to you at all. (Long pause.) Total silence.",

And the guns. And the power of sight. Which is exactly what you want out of a minion, really. That’s, like, three of the top four things one generally wants out of a minion. You’ll figure out the fourth when the time is right. (beat.) The fourth is pizzazz.",
          "Nice boomsticks, friendo! You're looking swank! Now, to get to Sanctuary, we've gotta retrieve my boat from the clutches of Captain Flynt. He's a real douche: dumb as a bag of wrenches, smells like old ham--",
          "I knew Hammerlock would come around eventually. Me and him are like two peas in a pod! Two bullets in a mag! Two cannibal midgets in a fat guy's ribcage!",

Still -- you know what’d make you feel better? A high-five from your buddy Claptrap. Just imagine it -- the sharp smack of hand against hand, the feeling of accomplishment, of brotherhood -- okay, I’m making it weird again. Sorry. Okay, how about this: I’ll count to three. If you haven’t high-fived me by the time I get to three I’ll assume you don’t want a high-five. Ready? One. Two. Three. (beat.) Okay, the three count was a dumb idea. You clearly want to high-five me, you’re just not sure how. I understand. Fear not, though -- you need only smack my hand, and bam -- high-five complete. Okay. Ready? ...Go!",

          "NOOOOO! DAMN YOU, STAIRS!",
          "Dammit, Jack -- how did you know stairs were my ONLY weakness?! Next to electrocution, and explosions, and gunfire, rust, corrosion, being kicked a lot, viruses, being called bad names, falling from great heights, drowning, adult onset diabetes, being looked at funny, heart attacks, exposure to oxygen, being turned down by women, and pet allergens! Your brilliance is matched only by your malevolence!",
          "You hear me, Jack?! You killed my friends! You destroyed my product line! I am the last Claptrap in existence, AND I AM GOING TO TEABAG YOUR CORPSE!",
          "A door?! You think a door can stop me, Jack?! I was MADE to open doors! HAHAHAHA!",

          "That’s right, Jack! I conquered your stairs! Prepare to feel the wrath of a CLAPTRAP WITH LEGS!",
          "This feels good. Feels right.",

          "Fuck that noise -- bring ME the fur, and I’ll give you a shotgun!",
          "I'm very disappointed in you, minion! (beat.) Now I'm over it. We're best friends again!",
          "FUR MOHAWK, BABY! WOOO! You made the right decision, minion.",
          "It's my birthday! I first rolled off the assembly line seven years ago! Do me a favor and hand out these invites for my stellar birthday bash, will ya? And quickly -- we're gonna start any minute!",
          "Minion! Over here! Your master commands you!",
          "(trying to maintain a semblance of authority) Well done, minion. You passed the tests. Just as I expected.",
          "Since I still don't hear you laughing about “chill out”, you must not understand humor in general. See, humor is based on subverting expectations, often through play-on words. According to this formula of humor, my “chill out” comment was literally the funniest thing ever said by anyone.",
          "Okay -- you've got dynamite on all the furnaces, which means it's time to set it all off! Go use the remote detonator I had one of the Crimson Raiders set up out there. When he asked me why, I just told him: BE COOL. (beat.) HOW ARE YOU NOT LAUGHING RIGHT NOW?! That was F*CKING GOLD!",
          "The statues are bulletproof? You win this round, inanimate object!",
          "Take THAT, easily-replaced decoration!",
          "Protect the bot, minion!",
          "Three - two - one -- DANCE TIME!",

          "You are looking FABULOOOOOOUS!",
          "Claptrap beatbox time, check it! (claptrap beatboxing)",
          "I used to be somebody. Granted, that “somebody” was an insane, megalomaniacal revolutionary who wanted to destroy all of humanity and over-used air quotes, but at least I was respected! (beat.) No I wasn't. Sigh.",
          "(making a really upbeat song out of it) Sad and lonely, sad and lonely -- lonely and sad! I got no friends but that's okay, cause at least I got…uh…hands. Hands and no friends, hands and no friends, that's the life for meeee.",
          "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Sorry. I was just thinking about the horrors I've seen since coming to Pandora. Won't happen again, I promise. (beat.) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Dang. My bad.",
          "Wanna hear the new dubstep song I wrote? Wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub DROP! (pause.) Wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub.",
          "It's a heck of a burden, being the last of your kind. Never will I hear the laugh of another Claptrap. Or dance alongside one. Or be tied to a pole and tortured with hot pokers by one because somebody reprogrammed its friend-or-foe priorities.",
          "I wonder if there are any other Claptraps out there who survived Jack's recall. I wonder what I'd say to them if we ever met. (beat.) Actually, I'd probably just tell them to shove off. There's only room enough for ONE dancing robot with a comedically divisive personality around here, and it's me!",
          "Anybody wanna check me out? Watch me dance? Listen to me tell you that there are new missions available on a bounty board? (beat) Heavy sigh.",
          "I gotta pee.",
          "You survived? I mean, uh, you survived! Yay! I totally expected that!",
          "Unce unce unce.",
          "So lonely.",
          "Continue to stare awkwardly at me, minion! Yessss. You follow orders well.",
          "Oh, I almost forgot, minion. If you hear anyone calling me “Clappy,” please politely explain my hatred for that nickname while you beat the stuffing out of them with a length of rebar.",
          "Soooooo...Moxxi said anything about me?",
          "I love you. What? Who said that? I didn’t say anything.",
          "Did you know my head is at your crotch level? I'm trying not to think about it.",
          "Others might find it unnerving when someone just stares at them for a long period of time without speaking. But me? I'm just happy to have you around!",
          "You make me so proud, minion. The way you're carrying on my fight against Handsome Jack -- it brings a tear to my eye. A figurative one, of course. The saline content of actual tears would rust my eye quicker than you could say “tetanus shot.”",
          "How you feelin', minion? You feelin' good? I'm feelin' good.",
          "You know, this whole last-of-my-kind thing isn't so bad. Gives me a lot of “me” time, you know? Time to think things over, defrag my hard drive, wonder if there is a robot heaven and, if so, whether my Claptrap brethren are in it -- you know, stuff like that. It involves lots of crying.",
          "Damn you, Jack! We could have settled this like MEN!",
          "Me! Me! Me! I know! I know!",
          "Pick me! Pick me!",
          "Yes! I NAILED it!",

Many thanks for disposing of them, by the way -- to survive a direct run-in with Handsome Jack *AND* defeat Captain Flynt's bandits? Unheard of. I’m headed to Sanctuary, myself -- from what I hear, the Crimson Raiders there could use a hero like you.",

          "Do you see my hat? It is the hat of a gentleman. And yet, it’s missing something -- some je ne sais quois. I think some bullymong fur might do the trick, if you could bring me some. To harvest Bullymong fur, you’ll need to rrrip it from their hides with your bare hands -- just weaken a Bullymong with gunfire, then finish him off with fisticuffs!",
          "I apologize, I wasn’t clear enough -- you see, you’ll need to kill the Bullymong with a melee attack in order to harvest its fur. Sure, you could try to steal the fur from a bullymong’s dead body, but where’s the fun in that? Blatantly unreasonable requests, ho!",
          "A stunning riposte! Now, collect the fur -- in addition to making for spectacular hat decoration, I shall study the fur for my almanac about the creatures of Pandora.",

          "I overheard Claptrap asking you for the Bullymong fur you’re collecting. As I fear he would do something irredeemably stupid with it, like make a mohawk out of it or something, let me sweeten the deal: if you bring me the fur, I shall give you one of my finest sniper rifles.",
          "A trillion thanks, Vault Hunter! You’ve helped a foolish old man look far more badass than he deserves. (beat.) I’m referring to myself, of course.",
          "You gave the fur to Claptrap? Suppose I can't blame you -- the lure of a shotgun is not easily resisted. No hard feelings, chum!",
          "These ECHOs shall be most enlightening!",
          "Handsome Jack killed her, did he? Shame -- a real shame. Please, return the ECHOs to me whenever you are capable of doing so.",
          "Some foolish types find Varkids ugly. They're so elegant -- beautiful creatures. Lovely. I long to see one transform.",
          "Lovely creatures. Beautiful creatures.",
          "Yes! You've killed the creature that removed my various limbs! I feel...well, slightly underwhelmed, to be honest. Mayhaps vengeance isn't all it's cracked up to be. Still, not your fault. Retrieve my arm and return at your leisure!",
          "Give me a moment, if you would -- I require some privacy.",
          "Oh dear. That might be the worst music ever recorded.",
          "Of course, I forgot -- the safehouse power box stopped working after Claptrap attempted to...integrate with it.",
          "Protection from bullets, ho!",
          "Welcome to Blackburn Cove, where Captain Flynt's men relax after a long day of murder and arson! Just raise the bridge to gain entry, and don't get shot to death.",
          "So, how goes the gunsmanship?",
          "Hello, mercenary person! I have money, and a problem.",
          "Greetings! Do you feel you have too many bullets but not enough money?",
          "Hullo! Things need to be shot, and by jove, you're the one to shoot them!",
          "Regrettably, I cannot hire you to exterminate things. Perhaps later.",
          "I say!",
          "Quite interesting, that.",
          "What's all this, then?",
          "What rubbish.",
          "ha HA!",
          "There are an awful lot of bosoms around here.",
          "This may be the most raucous public house I've ever been to.",
          "What on earth is that smell? Anyone -- anyone smell that? No? Just me. Right.",
          "Excuse me, madam! You, with the makeup -- could I have some lager, please? (Beat.) Completely ignored. Wonderful.",
          "Is that Moxxi woman staring at me again? Fancies me, I fear. Poor girl's barking up the wrong tree.",
          "Ah, I knew my faith was not misplaced!",
          "Please, tell me of your success!",
          "I'm sorry. Should I pay you up front? Not terribly well-versed in mercenary relations, I'm afraid.",
          "I see you're admiring one of my many scars! Yes, I've seen my fair share of danger – the odd skag ambush here, a stalker mauling there. Really gives one an appreciation for the creatures of this planet. And a...hateful desire to wipe them all out.",
          "You need not hesitate, friend: I assure you, you will be fully credited in the dedication page of my almanac once it is published. To...your name, it will say, without whom this book would not be as incredibly well-written and popular as it is, and whose refusal of any and all subsequent royalties for their part in the book's production was very much appreciated. It'll be a very long page.",
          "Your continued efforts against Handsome Jack are an inspiration! Had I still the constitution for it, I'd be right alongside you on the battlefield.",
          "I'm still trying to decide on cover art for my almanac. I'm torn between a oil painted image of myself, leaping over a Bullymong with a rifle in one hand and a book in the other, or the same image, except the Bullymong is also exploding. Decisions, decisions.",
          "I remember when my father first brought me to Pandora. I was six years old, and had used colorful language in polite company. Father thought it proper to abandon me here for a month to teach me the error of my ways. It was rough going at first, but after I throttled my twentieth skag into submission, I grew to enjoy the place.",
          "I must say, you vault hunters are of considerable interest of me. I shall have to write a book on you one day. \"Hunting the Vault Hunters,\" I shall call it, \"by Sir Hammerlock.\" And beneath that will be an image of you and I high-fiving over Handsome Jack's corpse. It'll be lovely.",
          "Are you admiring my hat? If not, you should be.",
          "Indecision, ho!",
          "No no no -- knock the crystals off with your melee weapon, then shoot the body. Good lad.",
          "Hammerlock, you're asking, \"how can you call the crystalisks lovely, then ask me to kill them?\" Simple -- the beauty of a creature can only be truly seen in its survival instincts. When a creature is nearest to death, you see how alive it can be. If you think that a slightly psychopathic worldview, no worries -- you wouldn't be the first!",
          "Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.",
          "Have you heard of these things called...Varkids? Allegedly, the buggers -- that's a pun, you see -- will morph if they take enough damage. Could you take this evolutionary injector, please?",
          "No no -- you musn't kill it before it transforms.",
          "AHH IT'S DISGUSTING KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT!",
          "Good lord, that was hideous. Please, bring me a sample of that Varkid's corpse, if you would. If we're to defend against these buggers -- there's that pun again -- we must know all we can about them.",
          "I realize we zoologists are meant to respect all of nature's creatures, but come on. Bugger looked like a pus-filled scab with wings.",
          "Bully-mong. Rubbish name, isn’t it? I’d like a better one before my almanac goes to print. Search some Bullymong bone piles, will you? I'll learn something about their diets, and come up with a catchier name for the beasts.",
          "Hrm -- it seems Bullymongs use those mounds to dispose of their refuse. That suggests a primate-level intelligence -- that's it! I shall call them primal beasts! I'll run it by my publishers -- in the meantime, blow up some Primal Beasts with grenades, would you? See how the new name works for you.",
          "What if we called them Ffferovores? Because they’re the most ferocious creatures I’ve ever seen, and I say that having watched a tyrant rip my arm from its socket. Repressed memories, ho! I’ll have to run it by my publishers -- in the meantime, loot a few Bullymong piles so I can learn about their diets.",
          "Rrgh! My publishers despise “Primal Beast.” Bloody uncultured...alright, what about Ffferovores? They’re the most ferocious creatures I’ve ever seen, and I say that having watched a Thresher rip my arm from its socket. Repressed memories, ho! Anyway, take the new name for a spin -- shoot some of the Ferovore's projectiles out of the air, see how the name thrills you.",
          "Bloody balls! “Ferovore” is trademarked! RRGH! Sod it! I’m so sick of coming up with names for -- you know what? “Bonerfart.” All of the -- that’s right, we’re calling them “Bonerfarts” now. Just kill a few of them, or something. I do not care anymore.",
          "My publisher says I can’t call them “Bonerfarts.” (sigh) Maybe Bullymong’s not so bad, after all. Come on back.",
          "Bullymong's still rubbish, but I'll come up with something better before I launch the almanac. I'm certain I will.",
          "You’re wondering why I don’t go out into the field. The answer is Old Slappy. A thresher that nearly killed me. Science demands I forgive it. Vengeance demands I kill it. Today, my friend, you will be my vengeance.",
          "Take my hand.",
          "Old Slappy removed several of my limbs the last time we met. One hopes the scent of my extremities will bring him out of hiding -- make him eager to finish the job, as it were. Plant my hand outside Slappy’s lair in the highlands.",
          "That’s right, Slappy. You smell it, don’t you? That’s the scent of a gentleman.",
          "Beware Slappy's tentacles -- you can blast them in half, but they'll regenerate sooner or later!",
          "The eyes! Go for the eyes!",
          "Vengeance, ho!",
          "Scientifically, murdering Old Slappy was probably a bad idea. Vengeance...istically, I thank you for your help.",
          "Those Crystalisks are right bastards, aren't they? Scientific term. If you could find out just what got up the Crystalisk's collective bum and made them so cross I'd be willing to pay you a pretty Penny. Metaphorically. I'll be paying you a great deal more than a Penny, it's just a saying I'm fond of. Off to the Caustic Caverns with you!",
          "Well, that was rather dark. Please return to me at your earliest convenience.",
          "Did I - did I ever do my whole \"man is the real monster\" speech for you? Comes to mind.",
          "An old boyfriend of mine, name of Taggart, was hired to wipe out the Stalker population a while back. He also, adorably, tried to write a book about his adventures in the Highlands. You find the chapters of his book, and I'll plagiarize the living daylights out of them for mine. Win-win-win, as they say! Nobody says that. I say it.",
          "Eaten, was he? Suppose there's a lesson to be learned in all of this. He who attempts to fight nature will?get?eaten. Sounded much more poignant in my head. Apologies.",
          "Would you like to do battle with a midget riding piggyback on a bullymong? If the answer is yes, please proceed to the Southern Shelf and defeat Midge-Mong for me. If the answer is no, you are sad, and I’ve no desire to speak with you further.",
          "Ah -- what an unlikely symbiotic relationship -- two deadly creatures cooperating to survive this harsh environment! Also, the midget looks like a little human backpack, and that’s funny.",
          "Wonderful! That fracas was most helpful to my studies on Bullymong social structures. Return to the bounty board at your earliest convenience.",
          "Exemplary!",
          "The town’s nearly clear. You go, girl, as they say. Does anyone say that anymore? I apologize.",
          "Please make Captain Flynt’s death as prolonged as possible, would you? Quite the douche, he is."

          "So, you want to hear another story, eh? One where the very fate of Pandora hangs in the balance? If not, too bad -- I’m telling you anyway. First, there was the Vault -- an alien prison opened with a mystical key. To the warriors who opened it, the vault was just a container of tentacles and disappointment. They vanished into the wastelands, certain that the Vault held no treasure at all. \nThey were wrong. The vault’s opening triggered the growth of Eridium, a priceless alien element. Soon, the rare and valuable mineral emerged all across Pandora. Its appearance attracted many. Including...the Hyperion corporation. \nThey came to Pandora to mine Eridium, and bring order to the savage planet. Through their excavations, Hyperion uncovered evidence of an even greater vault. Their leader vowed to find it -- to use its power to civilize the Borderlands, once and for all. But Hyperion weren’t the only ones searching for the next Vault’s alien power. The call of danger and loot is not so easily resisted. \nCertain warriors came to Pandora in droves to uncover its hidden secrets. Some would call them adventurers. Others call them fools. But I...call them vault hunters. \nOur story begins with them, and with a man named Handsome Jack...",

          "Explosive guns do… okay damage to all enemy types, but they have a sizable blast radius. Try it out!",
          "See? The damage wasn't amazing, but it's equally effective against shields, armor, or flesh. But really, who cares? Explosions!",
          "See how the acid eats through the metal? I must confess -- I love corrosive weapons.",
          "Now, let's try out these new slag guns!",
          "Slag is a bit more complex. If you slag your enemy, all NON-slag damage will hurt even more! Here -- slag this chump.",
          "Great! The weapons work, and you're ready to take on Handsome Jack. Now, let's talk about your payment.",
          "If you want to purchase any elemental weapons like these, you could always buy some from your friendly neighborhood arms dealer.",
          "Jack blasted my personal safe out of my own store! My most precious treasure could be in the hands of some freeloading bandits by now! Head back to that city-sized hole in the ground and get my safe back!The player gets an objective: Retrieve Bank Vault.",
          "Son of a slag -- the safe must have tumbled into the caverns. I heard from Crazy Earl that some bandits are going after it -- get after them!",
          "You found the safe? Ohhh, thank god. Open it, and return its contents, quickly!",
          "Ahhhh. Gazongas.",
          "Curses! Those idiots dropped my safe into the Caustic Caverns. Get after it!",
          "I knew I hadn't heard the last of that gun. I bought it off a guy a few months ago. Great gun, but it's...cursed. I sold it to a bandit named Horace.",
          "Dear [Roland,] I can’t help but notice the [Bloodshots] you are fighting pack some seeeeerious firepower. If you are going to have a chance against them, you’ll need to up your arsenal -- you could always arm your men with some high-quality munitions from my store. If you buy from me, those [Bloodshots] will be dead in no time!",
          "Dear [Bloodshots,] I can’t help but notice the [Crimson Raiders] you are fighting pack some seeeeerious firepower. If you are going to have a chance against them, you’ll need to up your arsenal -- you could always arm your men with some high-quality munitions from my store. If you buy from me, those [Crimson Raiders] will be dead in no time!",
          "Again with the thievering?",
          "I should probably lock that.",
          "Dude. Not cool.",
          "Congrats -- you're the first person to have stolen from me and lived.",
          "We'll just call that a loan.",
          "You're paying me back for that later. Whether you like it or not.",
          "I've killed men for less. Well, ordered their deaths. Same thing.",
          "Yes, by all means. Rob my store in front of me.",
          "Hey. Come on.",
          "Stop stealing from me!",
          "I'm not a price gouger -- you're just buying too many bullets!",
          "Supply and demand, bitches!",
          "If you've got a problem with my prices, blame the Eridium economy!",
          "The stronger you get, the more I'll charge! Deal with it!",
          "Get over here. I got work.",
          "Jackpot!",
          "Time to take a load off.",
          "Ah, crap.",
          "Come on, work already!",
          "Hehe.",
          "Wanna make some money? I've got jobs for you back in Sanctuary. Get over here, chop chop!",
          "I knew I could count on you.",
          "Ah. Always trust a mercenary.",
          "You do good work, my friend.",
          "Opportunity is knocking, friend! Will you answer, or blast a hole through the door?",
          "Moxxi hasn't mentioned me lately, has she? Eh, probably not.",
          "I miss my bus.",
          "Stay away from Crazy Earl's black market, friend. Never trust a man who won't accept cold, hard cash.",
          "Come back anytime!",
          "Farewell, friend!",
          "I'm sure we'll be doing this again soon enough!",
          "tell your friends: Marcus munitions!",
          "Remember, we're always open!",
          "Good luck!",
          "Don't have TOO much fun!",
          "Don't die, I need your business!",
          "Goodbye, friend! If you shop anywhere else I'll have you killed!",
          "Two words, my friend: no refunds.",
          "A pleasure as always!",
          "Pleasure doing business!",
          "Caveat emptor!",
          "Lovely!",

          "Nothing like a good sale!",
          "May it keep you safe in your travels!",
          "Thanks for the scratch!",
          "Nice to get back some of that money you stole from me.",
          "Welcome to my humble shop!",
          "Welcome, customer!",
          "Let me know if anything catches your eye.",
          "You won't find better merchandise anywhere else! I've made sure of that.",
          "High quality, low prices, and no questions asked!",
          "It's a fine day, full of opportunity!",
          "A fantastic day for capitalism!",
          "Feeling overburdened by money?",
          "Let's just get this out of the way – yes, most of my merchandise was ripped from the hands of dead adventurers.",
          "When you think “murder,” think “Marcus muntions!”",
          "I've always got new stock -- check back later!",
          "I'll always buy guns you don't need!",
          "Don't get killed!",
          "I'm always happy to take your money!",
          "Your cash ain't worth a thing if you don't spend it!",
          "Check back later to see my new Weapon of the Day!",
          "See you soon!",
          "Always happy to do business with a Vault Hunter!",
          "Tear the bad guys a new one, eh?",
          "Later, Vault Hunter!",
          "Capitalism, baby!",
          "No refunds.",
          "Tell your friends where you got that!",
          "A pleasure.",
          "May it serve you well!",

          "That'll cause some pain!",
          "Bang!",
          "Enjoy your new instrument of death!",
          "Now get to killing!",
          "Bad luck -- no loot for you!",
          "The donation was fine, but I was like, eh.",
          "Didn't feel like giving you anything this time. Deal with it.",
          "The wise Marcus does not smile upon you. You get nothing.",

          "This is better than the usual crap I give out.",
          "This ain't the best I have to offer, but it's not the worst.",
          "Marcus smiles upon you! Consider yourself lucky!",
          "You deserve the best -- so here it is!",
          "Loot doesn't get ANY better than that!",
          "This is the best I have to offer!",
          "You have pleased me VERY much!",
          "That ain't enough money.",
          "The wise Marcus demands tribute! Get some more cash!",
          "I'm running a religion here -- bring me some REAL money!",
          "This ain't a charity!",
          "The wise Marcus requires money. Go get some.",

          "The great Marcus can't do a thing with that gear!",
          "I got no recipes for that gear. Try something else!",
          "That gear's no good to the great Marcus Kincaid!",
          "You can always trust the gun at your side!",

          "What can I do you for? Wait... I'm not that kind of girl... Wait... Yes I am...",
          "Well hello there.",
          "You need me again, sweet lips?",
          "Hey, sugar -- wanna help a lady out?",
          "Like what you see?",
          "You know, you're not like the others. I can throw out a saucy innuendo and an animal noise at these goons and they're putty in my hands. But you? You're made of firmer stuff. Me-oww.",
          "I'm a bit tired, so just imagine I said something incredibly suggestive, will you?",
          "Oh, you sweet thing.",
          "Always love a good tip.",
          "Haha, you're gonna make me blush!",
          "Tiger growl!",
          "You keep that up, I might just have to pay you back somehow.",
          "Just when I thought you couldn't get any more attractive.",
          "Spending all that money on little ol' me? I'm flattered.",
          "I haven't seen someone throw that much money around since... my last boyfriend.",
          "Hell, I'm all wet. I mean -- I spilled a drink. Before you came in. Not 'cause you tipped me. Good god, I'm not that easy.",
          "Awwh, you're makin' me as shy as a hooker in confession! I'm not a hooker, though. Don't go spreading that around.",
          "I'll be able to rebuild the Underdome in no time!",
          "You remind me of my last boyfriend. Think you met him. Name of Jack. Real charmer, at first. Always opening doors for me, *telling me I'm beautiful, shooting anyone in the face if they looked at me sideways. Course, then he got clingy and I *dropped him like a bad habit -- which as it turns out, wasn't the best idea.",
          "One step closer to rebuilding the Underdome. Jack didn't take it too well when I kicked him to the curb. Way he figured it, if he couldn't have the thing he loved, neither could I. He sent his goons to burn the Underdome to the ground. I think he's planning to rebuild it in his own image, but he's missing the stuff that made it great... the flash, the pizzazz, the personality... and his tits aren't as nice.",
          "They say money can't buy you love, but it's a damned good replacement. Though, Mordecai might disagree with that. Poor guy... I offered him a rakk hive's worth of guns and cash for winning the top spot in my Underdome, but he never wanted any of it. If I had a nickel for every time he asked me to run away with him? Well, I wouldn't need a tip jar, that's for sure.",
          "Thanks for the tips, sugar. I think it's time your generosity was... rewarded.",
          "I tell ya, sugar: the resistance was desperate for someone like you. Roland's a real sweetheart, but everybody knows this city's just a skagleap away from getting torn apart by Hyperion or the bandits. We all thought we were safe in New Haven a few years back, but that... that didn't turn out so well.",
          "I appreciate it, darlin' -- business hasn't been so hot since Hyperion rolled into town. They talk big about cleaning up the wasteland and civilizing Pandora, but it really just comes down to two things: money and control. And Hyperion wants both.",
          "You met Ellie yet? Lovely girl. Hates my guts. I tried to explain to her, there's no harm in putting just a little effort into your appearance. A little rouge here, some dieting there -- reasonable requests, I thought -- but a few years of that were enough to make her move out to The Dust. Said something about making her own way, that she didn't need Scooter or I. Kids, you know?",
          "Thanks! This place ain't doing great, but it's still doing better than most -- nothing dulls the pain of losing a war quite like a strong glass of rakk-ale.",
          "Appreciated, sugar. That reminds me of something Jimbo Hodunk told me right before me and the kids left his disgusting bandit clan forever. He said, Hng dong pohng, bern-downg, hash-bohn buh-ba. Jowm, hmm. I'll never forget that.",
          "You haven't met the Hodunks yet, have you? Bastards, every one of 'em. They think just 'cause you're born into their stupid clan, you have to follow their rules, date who they tell you to date, murder who they tell you to murder, and -- yeugh. Good lawrd, I am so glad the kids and I left that STUPID clan fer-- oh god. Oh god, did I go back into the accent? Oh no. Oh crap. DON'T TELL ANYBODY.",
          "Fair warning: you call me wench, I shoot you in the kneecap.",
          "Have a drink, gamble, or punch my more douchebaggy clientele until they explode. Up to you.",
          "So, I'm in a world entirely of Tiny Tina's creation, huh? If it weren't for how great my rack looks, I'd say this might be what hell is like.",
          "Ellie gets to be the cool swordmaster, and I'm a tavern owner? Friggin' typecasting.",
          "Given the setting, I should probably have some fantasy-themed innuendos ready. Mind if I bounce 'em off you? Ahem. I'd like to tame your dragon, if you know what I -- nope, that... this is awful. Totally forced. Pretend it never happened.",
          "Yeah... I'm lookin' pretty good.",
          "Hey, has Moxxi mentioned me? Wait, that made no sense.",
          "Everybody's thinking it, so I'll just say it: Tavern Moxxi cosplay! Works for medieval faires, conventions, or postmodern feminist rallies."

          "Sir Reginald is only one of the many illustrious guests who will be attending my tea party. I have also invited Princess Fluffybutt, who has gazongas like you would not be-lieeeeve. You'll be roundin' her up lataz.",
          "GAAAH. Here I am about to throw a tea party and the guest of honor is missing! Do me a flava and lure our guest to the party or I'll eat your babies. His name's Flesh-stick, by the by. The by.",
          "There he is -- Flesh-stick, the guest of honor. You just lure him back to my abode, and I'll do the rest.",
          "*(sing-songy)* Seein' him makes me scared as crap and I don't -- remember -- whyyyy.",
          "Don't hurt our guest too much, bucko. Can't attend a tea party if you're dead!",
          "Looks like Flesh-stick stopped followin' yo fine ass. Best give him a poke so he'll start runnin' after yas again.",
          "GAAAH! I told you not to kill him! Blegh. It's okay. I still love you.",
          "Flesh-stick's lookin' pretty wounded, bra. Better lay off shootin' him.",
          "You're cordially invited, bitch!",
          "Good job, friendo. Flesh-stick's gettin' sucked through the tunnels as we speak. Let's talk!",
          "Flesh-stick's in the men's. Gettin' all pretty for the big occasion.",
          "Time for the party! You're gonna be the waiter. Hit Mister Sparks over there to bring in mista Flesh-stick.",
          "When you're ready to start the party, please smack mister Flesh-stick in his bitch face.",
          "Oh, I forgot to mention -- I'm inviting Flesh-stick's friends, too. Make sure they don't get too rowdy and break the generator!",
          "WHO'S READY FOR A MOTHAHUMPIN' TEA PARTAAAAAAAAAY?",
          "I agree, Princess. It is a bit cold for this time of year. What do you think, Mister Flesh-stick?",
          "Please continue to greet Flesh-stick's friends in the manner to which you are accustomed.",
          "What was that, Princess? I can't hear you over the sound of Fleshstick's friends. They are being quite rude.",
          "Another crumpet, Princess?",
          "Garcon, Mister Sparks is takin' a lot of damage and it is RUINING MY DINING EXPERIENCE.",
          "Mister Sparks is halfway dead, waiter! I would request you protect it a teensy bit more efficiently!",
          "Mister Sparks is almost dead! And I haven't even served dessert yet!",
          "NO! Mister Sparks is dead -- this tea party is OVER!",
          "Well -- that was quite an enjoyable tea party. Garcon? A word.",
          "Ahem. If you did not hear me, garcon, I requested that you smack that sucka in his piehole to start the festivities.",
          "Now to bode farewell to Mister Flesh-stick.",
          "Ah, the hour grows late. I'm afraid mister fleshstick must bid us adieu.",
          "Best. Tea party. Eva.",
          "What an interesting point, Monsieur Fleshstick! Mister Sparks, what do you think?",
          "Ya ya ya. Party party party. Best day eva. Party party party. So much party. Party party party. Party-til-you-drop. Say it again!",
          "I read the most EXTRAORDINARY thing the other day, Sir Reginald. Something about slag experimentation -- I forget the details.",
          "Fleshstick! How DARE you interrupt Sir Reginald?!",
          "Best tea party ever.",
          "Do you enjoy the tea, Mister Fleshtick? It is imported from the savage lands of the East.",
          "Why thank you, Princess Fluffybutt. I rather enjoy its taste myself.",
          "Dunno why, but that felt pretty good! Pretty ace.",
          "Fluffybutt. Sir Reginald. I have heard some salacious rumors about the two of you -- is there any truth to them?",
          "Don't be ridiculous, Fluffybutt -- you can trust me! I shall never gossip!",
          "Fleshstick! Let us discuss current affairs.",
          "Well, that's HARDLY appropriate tea party conversation. Mister Sparks?",
          "Really? Go on!",
          "Fluffybutt -- you never told me you were getting ENGAGED! Who's the lucky man?",
          "I must say, darling, you're marrying beneath yourself. You could do much better.",
          "Yo yo yo yo yo. Less' blow stuff up.",
          "Lilith told me there's a train fulla money comes around here. Sounds like a job for high explosives, am I right? I got some boomers in the back. Git 'em.",
