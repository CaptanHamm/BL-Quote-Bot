And I wasn't supposed to die by the hands... of a CHILD KILLING PSYCHOPATH!! You're a savage! You're a maniac, you are a bandit, AND I AM THE GODDAMN HERO!!",
			"I will pay you to kill yourself.",
			"Oh, for the LOVE of - okay. Great. Success. You're pissing me off. Good for you! Here's your prize!",
			"Oh come ON! What's wrong with that statue? I'm holding the Vault Key and a BABY. You know what babies are, right? Those little soft pink things your kind eats after you're done rolling around in your own feces? Ring a bell?",
			"What is this even ACCOMPLISHING?! Are you trying to piss me off? Was that your goal? Well mission accomplished, jaggoff. Y'know, when I'm curbstomping your dumb ass to death, you can take solace in the fact that, one time, for like, eight seconds, you mildly irritated me. Good for you. Your parents must be so proud.",
			"Yeah - no - go ahead. Knock that last one down. I've already got a great idea for a new statue. It's just gonna be me - kicking you - in the junk. I'm gonna commission like fifteen of those sumbitches and put 'em everywhere!",
			"You are such a jackass.",
			"...This guy rushes me with a spoon. A fricking spoon. And I'm just laughing. So I scoop out his eyeballs with it, and his kids are all, \"aghhhhh!,\" and, ah...you had to be there. Anyway, the moral is: you're a bitch.",
			"Oh, get over it. I shot ONE baby. And, in fairness, it was being a dick.",
			"You feel that? That electricity in the air when you're just aching to murder someone? Haven't felt that in such a long time.",

			"Testing? Testing one two? One two. And now I have the voice of a douchebag. Great. ",
			"Ol' balloon-tits is still holdin' a grudge against me, huh? Don't get me wrong, I understand it -- once you've eaten prime rib for free, it's hard to go back to suckin' down hamburgers for cash. If you know what I'm talking about. ",

			"I dislike Claptrap, and hope he dies",
			"That sounds like a reaaaaally crappy band name.",

			"Hey, sugar -- wanna help a lady out?",
			"Like what you see?",
			"You know, you're not like the others. I can throw out a saucy innuendo and an animal noise at these goons and they're putty in my hands. But you? You're made of firmer stuff. Me-oww.",

			"Oh, you sweet thing.",
			"Always love a good tip.",
			"Haha, you're gonna make me blush!",
			"Tiger growl!",
			"You keep that up, I might just have to pay you back somehow.",
			"Just when I thought you couldn't get any more attractive.",
			"Spending all that money on little ol' me? I'm flattered.",
			"I haven't seen someone throw that much money around since... my last boyfriend.",
			"Hell, I'm all wet. I mean -- I spilled a drink. Before you came in. Not 'cause you tipped me. Good god, I'm not that easy.",
			"Awwh, you're makin' me as shy as a hooker in confession! I'm not a hooker, though. Don't go spreading that around.",
			"I'll be able to rebuild the Underdome in no time!",
			"You remind me of my last boyfriend. Think you met him. Name of Jack. Real charmer, at first. Always opening doors for me, *telling me I'm beautiful, shooting anyone in the face if they looked at me sideways. Course, then he got clingy and I *dropped him like a bad habit -- which as it turns out, wasn't the best idea.",
			"One step closer to rebuilding the Underdome. Jack didn't take it too well when I kicked him to the curb. Way he figured it, if he couldn't have the thing he loved, neither could I. He sent his goons to burn the Underdome to the ground. I think he's planning to rebuild it in his own image, but he's missing the stuff that made it great... the flash, the pizzazz, the personality... and his tits aren't as nice.",
			"They say money can't buy you love, but it's a damned good replacement. Though, Mordecai might disagree with that. Poor guy... I offered him a rakk hive's worth of guns and cash for winning the top spot in my Underdome, but he never wanted any of it. If I had a nickel for every time he asked me to run away with him? Well, I wouldn't need a tip jar, that's for sure.",
			"Thanks for the tips, sugar. I think it's time your generosity was... rewarded.",
			"I tell ya, sugar: the resistance was desperate for someone like you. Roland's a real sweetheart, but everybody knows this city's just a skagleap away from getting torn apart by Hyperion or the bandits. We all thought we were safe in New Haven a few years back, but that... that didn't turn out so well.",
			"I appreciate it, darlin' -- business hasn't been so hot since Hyperion rolled into town. They talk big about cleaning up the wasteland and civilizing Pandora, but it really just comes down to two things: money and control. And Hyperion wants both.",
			"You met Ellie yet? Lovely girl. Hates my guts. I tried to explain to her, there's no harm in putting just a little effort into your appearance. A little rouge here, some dieting there -- reasonable requests, I thought -- but a few years of that were enough to make her move out to The Dust. Said something about making her own way, that she didn't need Scooter or I. Kids, you know?",
			"Thanks! This place ain't doing great, but it's still doing better than most -- nothing dulls the pain of losing a war quite like a strong glass of rakk-ale.",
			"Appreciated, sugar. That reminds me of something Jimbo Hodunk told me right before me and the kids left his disgusting bandit clan forever. He said, Hng dong pohng, bern-downg, hash-bohn buh-ba. Jowm, hmm. I'll never forget that.",
			"You haven't met the Hodunks yet, have you? Bastards, every one of 'em. They think just 'cause you're born into their stupid clan, you have to follow their rules, date who they tell you to date, murder who they tell you to murder, and -- yeugh. Good lawrd, I am so glad the kids and I left that STUPID clan fer-- oh god. Oh god, did I go back into the accent? Oh no. Oh crap. DON'T TELL ANYBODY.",
			"Fair warning: you call me wench, I shoot you in the kneecap.",
			"Have a drink, gamble, or punch my more douchebaggy clientele until they explode. Up to you.",
			"So, I'm in a world entirely of Tiny Tina's creation, huh? If it weren't for how great my rack looks, I'd say this might be what hell is like.",
			"Ellie gets to be the cool swordmaster, and I'm a tavern owner? Friggin' typecasting.",
			"Given the setting, I should probably have some fantasy-themed innuendos ready. Mind if I bounce 'em off you? Ahem. I'd like to tame your dragon, if you know what I -- nope, that... this is awful. Totally forced. Pretend it never happened.",
			"Yeah... I'm lookin' pretty good.",
			"Hey, has Moxxi mentioned me? Wait, that made no sense.",
			"Everybody's thinking it, so I'll just say it: Tavern Moxxi cosplay! Works for medieval faires, conventions, or postmodern feminist rallies.",
